  🎓 Cursor Prompt for Tomorrow

  When you open Cursor tomorrow, use this prompt:

  I'm starting Day 1 of Week 1 - building the foundation layer.

  Context files to read:
  1. AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Week 1, Day 1-2)
  2. .cursorrules (coding standards)
  3. docs/specs/API_CONTRACTS.md (Persona data model)
  4. MICROSOFT_FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md (architecture)

  Task: Implement src/foundation/agents/persona.py

  Requirements:
  - Persona and Permission classes
  - Full type hints
  - Docstrings
  - 100% test coverage

  Use Microsoft Agent Framework (already installed):
  - We're NOT building BaseAgent (use Microsoft's ChatAgent)
  - We're NOT building MCPClientManager (use Microsoft's MCPTool)
  - We ARE building our unique Persona system

  Please implement following the plan in AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

  Primary file to follow: AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

  This is your day-by-day implementation guide with complete code examples. Everything else is supporting reference.

  Simple Flow:
  1. Today: Read understanding docs (40 min) + setup
  2. Tomorrow: Open AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md → Week 1 → Day 1
  3. Daily: Follow the plan, reference API_CONTRACTS.md and TESTING_STRATEGY.md as needed
